## Installation
This is a java based software that can be build and run through IntelliJ and relies on the java ImageJ library and SimpleElastix toolkit on top of common java libraries.

### Requirements
Windows 64-bit version

min 2GB of free RAM, Min 4GB of RAM per core?

(min 3GB of frre disk space + size of file + size of cmake + SimpleElastix)

### 4. Install SimpleElastix

SimpleElastix requires compiling the C++ SimpleElastix project and needs therefore Visual Studio and CMake. Out software is compatible with Visual Studio 2019 and CMake-3.19. 

#### Download SimpleElastix from github at: https://github.com/SuperElastix/SimpleElastix

#### Download CMake-3.19 from: https://cmake.org/download/
  - Download Windows win64-x64 ZIP
  - Unzip to your path of preference

#### Download Visual Studio 2019 from: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
  - Select version of preference and an installer will automatically download
  - Run the executable
  - Make sure to select the downloading of Desktop development with C++
  - Launch install and downloading
  
#### Build SimpleElastix project
  - Open CMake GUI from the bin folder where you extracted CMake
  - Create a 'build' directory for CMake. Make sure the path the that directory is short, eg. a directory called 'buildSimpleElastix' at the root of your harddrive.  
  - Add the path of the SuperBuild directory of downloaded SimpleElastix folder to 'Where is the source code:'
  - Add the path to the directory created for CMake, eg 'C:/buildSimpleElastix' to 'Where to build the binaries'
  - Press 'Configure' button, a pop-up should open and display 'Visual Studio xx 2019' for 'Specify the generator for this project' and 'Use default native compilers' should be selected. Press 'Finish'.
  - Unselect all the files except 'WRAP_JAVA'. This will shorthen the compilation time.
  - Press the Generate button
  
  - Open Visual Studio, select File -> Open Project/Solution -> Open and choose SuperBuildSimpleITK which is located in the folder where the binary files where created with CMake, eg. C:/buildSimpleElastix
  - Build the ALL_BUILD project after checking that "Release" build type is selected and x64 is selected too. Building the project might take a few hours(around 2 hours).
